                Let me use this time to say now that I've never had a 'job' in the software or web development field--all things I've done have been on my own time. What I lack in work experience, I've been trying my best to make up for by at least having some tangible work and learning as much as I can. Below are some of my projects I'd like to showcase to anyone willing to look. Each thumbnail is linked to its respective github repo or website (if applicable)--actually though, I default to use <a href="https://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a> since I work alone and sometimes for work purposes (trying to not get hacked here), so the cloned repos may not be updated as often as their original counterparts. I'll try to remember to keep them up to to date for you guys and gals whom are interested.

                    I think it would make sense to showcase the code behind this website first. Simple, I know, but you can't deny that it works--just how I like my stuff.

                    Originally this was but made with Express, Pug, and jQuery. Now, this baby is a React/Redux application that does a better job at being maintainable than the previous iterations. While the frontend may have gotten an overhaul, the express backend is pretty much the same, but with a teeny bit less of an API footprint. Handling multiple users and authentication for certain actions is next up on the implementation schedule.

                    One of the websites I've done from scratch for where I currently work, In the near future, the booking process will be redone as well (probably by me as well :P)
