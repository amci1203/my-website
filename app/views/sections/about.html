                <p>Ever since I was old enough to actually have a tangible idea of what I wanted to be, I dreamed of becoming a game programmer--I still do (maybe one day), but I've come to realize that I do really like programming in general. I will be the first to admit that it sometimes is a real pain, but that's usually when I simply am not at my best or straight up frustrated (which happens less as I learn and do more), and more importantly, the 'AHA!' moments when everything works as it should is well worth it. Not to mention that it makes life easier for somebody who could use one less stress in their life. It gets hard, but as long as I feel as though my effort will <em>actually help somebody</em>, I'm ready for the long haul.</p>

                As I'm fairly certain many people do, My first experience with anything development related was with HTML &amp; CSS on Codeacademy, and Java in college (to be honest, one of the only classes I am truly glad I got to take while I was in school, thank you Mr. Wing Tong). I also played with some Javascript and PHP while I was in school on my own time, and two years in, I truly lost my resolve as to why I was in school moving at a snail's pace in its Computer Science Program  when I am fully capable of learning what I want, when I want, how I want. So against my and everyone else's better judgement, I ended up leaving school and returning home to The Bahamas.

                Nowadays, I spend most of my time on my laptop, either on Brackets (my current favorite editor), Udemy, or wherever there's a good nugget on the internet. So far, I can write enough PHP and SQL to get by, but I'm not a huge fan, and I've tried a bit of Python too, but again, it doesn't strike my interest too much. And I've looked at Ruby on Rails and actually liked it, but quickly realized that I was better off sticking to the Javascript environment due to the former being nowhere near as ubiquitous and malleable as the latter--and oh how I love the Javascript scene. I truly believe that I couldn't choose a better time to get into it, with the ES6 specification, Node.js, and the array of frameworks it has to offer; it's alot to learn, yes, but learning is pretty fun when it's something you like. As of now, I equally love the back and front end (which I guess is a good thing :) ), and have been focusing mainly on web development/design; soon, I'll be taking a much needed leap onto Android and iOS development, and being an IT Technician (if you can't tell, I love computers), I'd love to hop on the IoT train as soon as the chance arrives.
